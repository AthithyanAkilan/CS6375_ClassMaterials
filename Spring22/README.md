# Spring 2022: Introduction to Machine Learning (Undergraduate Version)

## Course Videos
Video Lectures: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGod0_zT9w93y14TbXOVQpmvrnLssdPkp

These are video recordings uploaded to youtube from my previous graduate version of this course. The course content will be very similar so I would strongly encourage all of you to go through the videos both before and after each course.
